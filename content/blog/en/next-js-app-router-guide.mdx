# Introduction to Next.js App Router

The App Router represents a significant evolution in Next.js architecture, introducing server components and a new paradigm for building React applications.

## Key Benefits

Server components allow us to render components on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance. This is particularly beneficial for content-heavy applications like blogs.

## Implementation Patterns

When building with App Router, we organize our routes using the file-system based routing, where each folder represents a route segment.

```typescript
// Example of a server component
export default async function BlogPost() {
  const post = await fetchBlogPost();
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and performance characteristics.
