# From Idea to Own Domain: Your 7-Day Roadmap

After helping dozens of small businesses in Puerto Rico establish their digital presence, I've perfected a process that **guarantees results in one week**, regardless of your technical level.

This isn't another generic tutorial. It's the exact system I've used with cafés in San Sebastián, consultancies in Las Marías, and stores in Mayagüez.

## Pre-Requirements: What You Need Before Starting

### Mental Preparation (Day 0)
- **Mindset**: Your domain is an investment, not an expense
- **Time**: 2-3 hours daily for 7 days
- **Budget**: $100-300 for the first year (less than 2 restaurant dinners)

### Tools We'll Use
- **Namecheap or GoDaddy**: To purchase the domain
- **Vercel or Netlify**: Free/economic hosting
- **Canva**: Basic design (free)
- **Google Workspace**: Professional email ($6/month)

## Day 1: Domain Selection and Purchase

### Step 1: Name Brainstorming (30 minutes)

**Important criteria**:
- Easy to remember and pronounce
- Related to your business
- Avoid numbers and hyphens
- .com is preferable (greater credibility)

**Helpful tools**:
```
Name generators:
• Namemesh.com
• Lean domain search
• Business name generator

Availability verification:
• Whois.net
• Namecheap.com/domain-search
```

### Step 2: Domain Purchase (15 minutes)

**Process on Namecheap** (my recommendation for price/service):
1. Search for your desired domain
2. Add to cart (.com for ~$8-12/year)
3. **DON'T add expensive extras** for now
4. Complete purchase

**⚠️ Important initial settings**:
- Activate WhoisGuard (privacy protection)
- Note your access credentials
- Verify confirmation email

### Step 3: Verification (15 minutes)
Confirm you can access the domain control panel. This is critical for the following steps.

## Day 2: Hosting and Professional Email Configuration

### Hosting: Vercel (Recommended for Beginners)

**Why Vercel**:
- Generous free plan
- Super simple configuration
- Excellent worldwide performance
- Scalable when you grow

**Configuration process**:
1. Register at vercel.com with your email
2. Connect your GitHub account (creates automatically)
3. Note the URLs it provides

### Professional Email: The Crucial Difference

**Impact comparison**:
- ❌ **contact@gmail.com** → Amateur
- ✅ **contact@yourbusiness.com** → Professional

**Google Workspace setup** ($6/month, worth every penny):
1. Go to admin.google.com
2. "Get started" → "My company doesn't have a domain"
3. Enter your purchased domain
4. Follow verification process
5. Configure your first email: contact@yourbusiness.com

### Domain ↔ Services Connection (Technical But Easy)

**In your Namecheap panel**:
1. Domain List → Manage
2. Advanced DNS → Add New Record

**Necessary configurations**:
```
For Vercel:
A Record → @ → 76.76.19.61
CNAME → www → cname.vercel-dns.com

For Google Workspace:
MX Record → @ → 1 aspmx.l.google.com
MX Record → @ → 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com
```

**💡 Pro tip**: These configurations take 24-48 hours to activate. Patience!

## Day 3: Site Design and Structure

### Information Architecture (1 hour)

**Essential pages for any business**:
1. **Home**: What you do, for whom, how to contact you
2. **Services/Products**: Detailed offering with prices
3. **About Us**: History, team, values
4. **Contact**: Form, location, hours
5. **Blog** (optional but recommended): SEO + expertise

### Design Tools Without Being a Designer

**Canva for Business** (free):
- Pre-made professional templates
- Stock photo library
- Consistent colors and fonts
- Web-optimized export

**Creation process**:
1. Select "Website" template relevant to your industry
2. Customize with your information
3. Maintain visual consistency (same color palette)
4. Export sections as web-optimized images

### Content Strategy: Content That Converts

**Formula for each page**:
1. **Clear headline**: What you do in 10 words
2. **Explanatory subheading**: How you help the customer
3. **Social proof**: Testimonials, logos, numbers
4. **Call to action**: What you want them to do

**Example for a restaurant**:
```
Headline: "Authentic Creole Food in the Heart of Mayagüez"
Subheading: "Traditional dishes made with family recipes
             passed down through 3 generations"
Social Proof: "Over 500 families choose us each week"
CTA: "Make your reservation now" / "See our full menu"
```

## Day 4: Website Implementation

### Quick Option: WordPress.com Business Plan

**Why WordPress for beginners**:
- Intuitive visual editor
- Professional themes included
- Plugins for specific functionalities
- Integrated basic SEO

**Setup process**:
1. WordPress.com → Business Plan ($25/month)
2. Connect your purchased domain
3. Select appropriate theme for your industry
4. Install essential plugins

### Basic SEO Configuration (30 minutes)

**In Yoast SEO**:
1. Configuration Wizard → Follow the process
2. Configure site title and description
3. Add your location if local business
4. Connect Google Search Console

**Critical settings**:
```
Site title: "Business Name | What You Do in City"
Description: "Attractive description in 150 characters with keywords"
Main keywords: 3-5 terms your customers search for
```

## Day 5: Content and Optimization

### Content Creation: Writing For Humans and Google

**Successful page structure**:
1. **H1** (main title): Include main keyword
2. **Intro paragraph**: Summarize main benefit
3. **H2** subsections: Organize information logically
4. **Calls to action**: Every 2-3 paragraphs

**Example structure for "Services" page**:
```markdown
